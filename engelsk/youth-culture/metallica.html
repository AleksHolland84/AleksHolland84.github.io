            <div id="indhold" class="main-menu-content-text">
              <p>Metallica is a legendary heavy metal band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, California.</p>  
            </div>

            <div clas="chapter-text">
              <p>The band consists of vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Lars Ulrich. They quickly rose to fame in the 80s and 90s with their unique blend of heavy metal and thrash, which became known as the "big four" of thrash metal. Metallica's early music was known for its fast, aggressive and complex playing style, as well as its dark and introspective lyrics.</p>
              <p>Metallica's impact on heavy metal and popular music in general has been immense. Their fifth album, 1991's "The Black Album," saw them shift from thrash metal to a more mainstream heavy metal sound, and became one of the best-selling albums of the 1990s. The album marked the beginning of a new era for the band, which saw them become one of the biggest acts in the world. They went on to release several more albums that sold millions of copies and established them as one of the biggest bands in the world.</p>
              <p>One of the most impressive aspects of Metallica's success is the way they have adapted and evolved over the years. From their early thrash metal days to their later, more polished sound, they have always remained true to their roots while experimenting with new musical styles and themes. They have remained one of the most influential and popular heavy metal bands for over three decades, and continue to tour and release new music today.</p>
              <p>Their music has also been widely covered and celebrated by other artists, cementing their status as one of the greatest bands in the history of heavy metal music. Whether you're a fan of heavy metal or not, there's no denying the impact that Metallica has had on popular culture and music as a whole. They have truly left a lasting legacy that will continue to inspire new generations of musicians and fans for years to come.</p>
