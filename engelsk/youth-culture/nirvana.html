            <h1>Nirvana</h1>
    
            <div id="indhold" class="main-menu-content-text">
              <p>Nirvana was an American rock band that was formed in 1987 in Aberdeen, Washington.</p>  
            </div>

            <div clas="chapter-text">
              <p>The band consisted of singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Dave Grohl. Nirvana became one of the most influential and successful bands of the early 1990s with their unique blend of punk, metal, and alternative rock.</p>
              <p>The band's debut album, "Bleach," was released in 1989, but it wasn't until the release of their second album, "Nevermind," in 1991 that Nirvana truly broke into the mainstream. "Nevermind" was an instant success, reaching number one on the Billboard 200 and selling over ten million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, "Smells Like Teen Spirit," became a hit, and Nirvana was soon hailed as the leaders of the grunge movement.</p>
              <p>Nirvana's music was characterized by Cobain's hauntingly raw vocals, abrasive yet melodic guitar riffs, and the band's aggressive and intense live performances. The band's lyrics dealt with issues like disillusionment, drug abuse, and social isolation, and their music resonated with a generation of young people who felt disconnected from mainstream society.</p>
              <p>In 1994, Kurt Cobain was found dead in his home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and Nirvana was disbanded. Cobain's death was a tragedy, but his legacy lives on through his music. Nirvana's impact on popular music and culture is undeniable, and their influence can still be felt today in countless contemporary bands.</p>
