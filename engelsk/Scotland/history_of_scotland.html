              <h4>History</h4>
              <p>The Scottish Wars of Independence were a series of conflicts fought between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. The wars were sparked by English attempts to assert control over Scotland and by Scottish resistance to English rule.</p>
                
              <p>The death of King Alexander III in 1286, and the death of his granddaughter and heir Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked Edward I of England to arbitrate, for which he extracted legal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing John Balliol, the man with the strongest claim, who became king in 1292. Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale, the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome with reluctance. Over the next few years Edward I used the concessions he had gained to systematically undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland.</p>
                <p>In 1296, Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The following year William Wallace and Andrew de Moray raised forces to resist the occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. For a short time, Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm.</p>
                <p>Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. In 1305, William Wallace fell into the hands of the English, who executed him for treason despite the fact that he owed no allegiance to England.</p>
                <p>John Comyn and Robert the Bruce were appointed as joint guardians in William Wallace’s place. On 10 February 1306, Bruce participated in the murder of Comyn, at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries, and less then seven weeks later, Bruce was crowned as king on 25 March. </p>
                <p>One of the key events of the Scottish Wars of Independence was the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, in which the Scottish army, led by Robert the Bruce, defeated the English. This victory was a major turning point in the conflict and helped to secure Scottish independence.</p>
                <p>In 1328, Edward III signed the Treaty of Edinburg-Northampton acknowledging the Scottish independence under the rule of Robert the Bruce. </p>
                <p>However, four years after Robert’s death in 1329, England once more invaded.</p>
                <p>The Scottish Wars of Independence had a significant impact on the country's history and continue to be a significant part of Scottish national identity today.</p>

              <h4>William Wallace</h4>
              <p>William Wallace was born in 1270 in Elderslie (Renfrewshire) into a gentry family. Little is known about his early life due to a lack of reliable sources.</p>
              <p>In later life, he grew to be one of Scotland’s greatest national heroes, famous for inflicting a famous defeat against the English army at Stirling Bridge (1297) and leading the rebellion against King Edward I.</p>
              <p>Wallace is considered a chief inspiration for Scottish resistance to King Edward I. He is remembered as the guardian of the kingdom of Scotland during the initial years of the long yet successful struggle to free the country from England’s rule.</p>  
              <p>William Wallace’s life is portrayed in the move, Braveheart, which when released in 1995 became an instant classic and eventually won an Oscar for best film. While it does portray the story of William Wallace and captures some basic facts accurately there are also may inaccuracies. </p>

              <h4>Robert the Bruce - The Outlaw King</h4>
              <p>Robert the Bruce was a Scottish nobleman who became the King of Scotland in 1306. He is best known for his role in the Scottish Wars of Independence, in which he led the Scottish army to victory against the Kingdom of England.</p>
              <p>Bruce was born in Scotland in the late 13th century and was a member of the Scottish nobility. In 1306, he was crowned King of Scotland after the death of his rival, John Balliol.</p>
              <p>During the Scottish Wars of Independence, Bruce faced many challenges, including a series of defeats at the hands of the English. However, he eventually emerged victorious at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, in which the Scottish army decisively defeated the English.</p>
              <p>After the wars, Bruce worked to strengthen the Scottish monarchy and to secure the country's independence. He died in 1329 and is remembered as one of Scotland's greatest kings.</p>
