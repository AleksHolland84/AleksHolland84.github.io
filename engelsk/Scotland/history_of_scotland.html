                <p>The recorded history of Scotland begins with the arrival of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, where the administrative regions of Ancient Rome reached as far north as the Antonine Wall, though later pushed south back to Hadrian's Wall. North of Antonine Wall was Caledonia, inhabited by the Picti.  </p>

                <h4>Though the history of Scotland is rich of events this course will focus on the first war in The Wars of Independence.</h4>
                <p><em>The Wars of Scottish Independence were a series of military campaigns fought between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.</em> </p>
                <h2>The First War of Independence (1296-1328)</h2>

                <p>The death of King Alexander III in 1286, and the death of his granddaughter and heir Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked Edward I of England to arbitrate, for which he extracted legal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing John Balliol, the man with the strongest claim, who became king in 1292. Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale, the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome with reluctance. Over the next few years Edward I used the concessions he had gained to systematically undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland.</p>
                <p>In 1296, Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The following year William Wallace and Andrew de Moray raised forces to resist the occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. For a short time, Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm.</p>
                <p>Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. In 1305, William Wallace fell into the hands of the English, who executed him for treason despite the fact that he owed no allegiance to England.</p>
                <p>John Comyn and Robert the Bruce were appointed as joint guardians in William Wallace’s place. On 10 February 1306, Bruce participated in the murder of Comyn, at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries, and less then seven weeks later, Bruce was crowned as king on 25 March. </p>
                <p>Bruce’s small army was defeated at the Battle of Methven and was excommunicated by Pope Clement V, though overturned by Pope John XXII. The nobles of Scotland also convinced the Pope to nullify the various acts of submission by Scottish kings so that Scotland’s sovereignty could be recognized by the major European dynasties. </p>
                <p>In 1328, Edward III signed the Treaty of Edinburg-Northampton acknowledging the Scottish independence under the rule of Robert the Bruce. </p>
                <p>However, four years after Robert’s death in 1329, England once more invaded.</p>

              <h4>William Wallace</h4>
              <p>William Wallace was born in 1270 in Elderslie (Renfrewshire) into a gentry family. Little is known about his early life due to a lack of reliable sources.</p>
              <p>In later life, he grew to be one of Scotland’s greatest national heroes, famous for inflicting a famous defeat against the English army at Stirling Bridge (1297) and leading the rebellion against King Edward I.</p>
              <p>Wallace is considered a chief inspiration for Scottish resistance to King Edward I. He is remembered as the guardian of the kingdom of Scotland during the initial years of the long yet successful struggle to free the country from England’s rule.</p>  
              <p>William Wallace’s life is portrayed in the move, Braveheart, which when released in 1995 became an instant classic and eventually won an Oscar for best film. While it does portray the story of William Wallace and captures some basic facts accurately there are also may inaccuracies. </p>
