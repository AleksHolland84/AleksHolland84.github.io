            <h3>Science Fiction</h3>
            <h4>What is science fiction?</h4>
            <p>Science fiction, also often known as 'sci-fi', is a genre of literature that is imaginative and based around science. It relies heavily on scientific facts, theories, and principles as support for its settings, characters, themes, and plot. Many of the storylines and plots within pieces of science fiction are possible or plausible according to science.</p>
            <p>Science fiction is usually futuristic and often presents alternative ways of life and living that are made possible by technological change. Science-fiction novels are similar to fantasy in that they imagine alternative worlds that exist outside the realms of our real world.</p>

            <h4>What are the five elements of science-fiction story writing?</h4>
            <p>Similar to other forms of fiction writing, science fiction contains the usual elements of the novel. These include a specific setting, character development, plot (central conflict, complications, climactic events, resolution), themes, and structure.</p>
        
            <ol>
              <li>Setting</li>
              <p>Setting is the context in which a story or scene occurs and includes the time, place, and social environment. It's important to establish a setting in your story, so your readers can visualize and experience it. Science-fiction settings tend to include space travel, new galaxies or futuristic times.</p>
              <li>Character</li>
              <p>A character is a person in a story - either a human, a fantasy character, mythical character or even an animal. Science fiction is no exception to this element of fiction writing and the characters in these stories often include aliens, time travelers and heroic adventurers.</p>
              <li>Plot</li>
              <p>The plot is the main event or events of a play, novel, film, or similar work, devised and presented by the writer as an interrelated sequence. The plot of science fiction usually centers around technological discoveries, time travel and alien invasions.</p>
              <li>Themes</li>
              <p>Theme is the main idea or underlying meaning a writer explores in a story. Many of science fiction's most common themes include space travel, time travel, utopias and dystopias, and encounters with alien life forms.</p>
              <li>Structure</li>
              <p>A structure is the basic events of a story and how its plot unfolds. Science-fiction stories are usually full of action, adventure and plot twists that make up the structure.</p>          
            </ol>

            <h4>What are some main components of science-fiction novels?</h4>
            <p>Here are some of the main features of science-fiction novels:</p>

            <div class="indent">
              <li>time travel</li>
              <li>teleportation</li>
              <li>mind control, telepathy, and telekinesis</li>
              <li>alien life forms, and mutants</li>
              <li>space travel and exploration</li>
              <li>parallel universes</li>
            </div>

            
            <p>Can you think of any novels you've read recently that have any of these features?</p>
