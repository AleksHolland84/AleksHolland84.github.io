                <p>Sunday 30 January 1972, known as Bloody Sunday, is considered one of the most significant events of the Troubles. After the tragedy, the Irish nationalists' hostility towards the British Army increased and the popularity of the Irish Republican Army (the IRA) increased.</p>
                <p>U2, an Irish rock band, made the political song Sunday Bloody Sunday that deals with this event. </p>

                <h4>The arrival of the British Army</h4>
                <p>The Catholic population often found itself at greater disadvantage economically and politically than the Protestant community. However, social and economic conditions were often very similar for working class Protestants.  </p>
                <p>Tensions spilled over in August 1969 during the annual Apprentice Boys of Derry march. The route of the march passed through the predominantly Catholic Bogside area of Derry. Attempts by the Royal Ulster Constabulary to separate residents from the marchers resulted in three days of rioting. The event became known as the Battle of Bogside and it caused unrest across Northern Ireland. The British Army was brought in to restore order. </p>
                
                <h4>Peacekeepers</h4>
                <p>The British Government ordered the deployment of troops to Northern Ireland in August 1969. This was to counter the growing disorder surrounding civil rights protests and an increase in sectarian violence during the traditional Protestant marching season.</p>
                
                <h4>Illegal paramilitaries</h4>

                      <div class="movie-description">
                        <p>But this optimism was misplaced. Despite the Army coming under the control of the Secretary of State for Defence in London, many Catholics saw it as a tool of the Unionist Government in Northern Ireland.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), which had formed in 1969 and whose membership was growing, increased levels of violence against both the police and the Army.</p>
                        <p>Loyalist paramilitary groups, including the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), intent on keeping the region part of the United Kingdom, also stepped up their campaign of sectarian violence.</p>
                        <p>The early 1970s also saw major rioting on both sides of the religious divide.</p>

              <h4>The events leading to Bloody Sunday</h4>
              <p>About 15,000 people gathered in the Creggan area of Derry on the morning of 30 January 1972 to take part in a civil rights march.</p>
              <div class="frame-container-center">

              </div>
              <p>Five months earlier, in August 1971 and against a backdrop of escalating violence and increased bombings in Northern Ireland, a new law was introduced giving the authorities the power to imprison people without trial - internment. The government had decided it was the only way it could restore order.</p>
              <p>Thousands gathered in Derry on that January day for a rally organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to protest at internment, though the Stormont government (Government of the Northern Ireland 1921-1972) had banned such protests.</p>
              <p>Troops were deployed to police the march.</p>

              <h4>How the day unfolded</h4>
              <p>The march began shortly after 15:00 GMT and the intended destination was the city centre. However, Army barricades blocked marchers. The majority of demonstrators were instead directed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside.</p>

                <img src="images/free_derry2.png" alt="free derrby image" width="100%">
                <p>Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests.</p>
                <p>Just before 16:00 GMT, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. Two men were shot and wounded.</p>
                <p>At 16:07 GMT, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible.</p>
                <p>At 16:10 GMT, soldiers began to open fire.</p>
                <P>According to Army evidence, 21 soldiers fired their weapons, discharging 108 live rounds between them.</P>

              <h4> Bloody Sunday 1972: The day's events explained </h4>
              <p>Bloody Sunday has become synonymous with the darkest period of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. But how did a protest march on January 30th 1972 lead to a massacre?</p>
              <p> Thirteen people were killed and a further 15 wounded after members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in the Bogside - a predominantly Catholic part of Londonderry (Derry). </p>
              <p> The image of a Catholic priest waving a blood-stained handkerchief as he helped a victim to safety was broadcast around the world.</p>
              <p> The Saville Inquiry, set up by Tony Blair in 1998, found that none of the casualties were posing a threat or doing anything that would justify their shooting.</p>
              <p> Victims' families have waited 47 years to see if there would be prosecutions. One former British paratrooper is to be charged with the murder of James Wray and William McKinney, and for the attempted murders of Joseph Friel, Michael Quinn, Joe Mahon and Patrick O’Donnell.</p>
