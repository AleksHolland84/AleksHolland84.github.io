              <h4>What You Need to Know About The Troubles</h4>
              <p>The Troubles is a term used to describe a period of conflict in Northern Ireland that lasted about 30 years, from the late 1960s until the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.</p>
              <p>However, the origins of the Troubles can be traced back hundreds of years. The Plantation of Ulster at the beginning of the 17th century settled Protestants from lowland Scotland and the North of England causing a sectarian split in the population of the province; something that still resonates today and fed into the Troubles. </p>
              <p>Catholics predominantly consider themselves Irish and hold nationalist views - they want an independent Ireland free from British control. Protestants identify largely as British and unionist, meaning they wish to remain linked to the United Kingdom.</p>

              <p>From 1969 to the early 2000s, Northern Ireland was gripped by a period of unrest commonly referred to as ‘The Troubles’. But how did this conflict begin, and who were the key players? IWM curator Carl Warner unpicks this complicated story in a five-minute explainer.</p>
