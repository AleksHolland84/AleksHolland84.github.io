    <h1>Rick and Morty (TV series)</h1>
    <p>Rick and Morty is an American adult animated television series created by <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Dan_Harmon">Dan Harmon</a> and <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Justin_Roiland">Justin Roiland</a> that premiered on December 2, 2013 on Cartoon Network's <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Adult_Swim">Adult Swim</a> programming block.</p>
    <p>The show's first season consists of 11 twenty-two minute episodes. After airing the first six episodes, Adult Swim renewed the show for a second season, consisting of 10 twenty-two minute episodes.</p>
    <p>The show was based on a series of crudely animated short films for Channel 101 based on a Back to the Future parody <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/The_Real_Animated_Adventures_of_Doc_and_Mharti">The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti</a> by Justin Roiland. </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="content">
    <h1>The Plot</h1>
    <p>After going missing for nearly 20 years, Rick Sanchez suddenly arrives at his daughter Beth’s doorstep looking to move in with her and her family. Beth welcomes him with open arms, but her unremarkable husband Jerry isn’t too thrilled about the tearful reunion as Rick’s arrival serves to shake things up quite a bit around the household. Rick converts the garage into his personal laboratory and gets to work on all sorts of dangerous sci-fi gadgets and contraptions. That wouldn’t be so bad if not for the fact that Rick continues to involve his grandchildren Morty and Summer in his insane adventures. With the exception of the Pilot episode, each episode ends with a post-credits scene</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <h1>Characters</h1>
    <div class="characters">
      <img src="images/char_rick.webp">
      <p><span>Rick Sanchez</span> (Voiced by Justin Roiland) (Season 1 - Season 6) — A genius scientist and alcoholic whose inventions and experiments serve as the basis for the episodes. The grandfather of Morty Smith and Summer Smith, and the father of Beth. Rick was absent from the family for years, until he finally returned before the Pilot episode to live with the Smith family, much to the disapproval of Jerry. He currently resides in the garage of the Smith house where his entire laboratory is based. Here, he builds new inventions, travels to other dimensions, and tests things out on forms of alien life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="characters">
      <img src="images/char_morty.jpg">
      <p><span>Morty Smith</span> (Voiced by Justin Roiland) (Season 1 - Season 6) — Rick's impressionable and socially awkward teenage grandson who is often dragged along on his grandfather's escapades. Morty is a wimpy and nervous wreck who desperately tries to keep his sanity when taken on the bizarre and terrifyingly mind-bending adventures that Rick takes him on, which is already big enough of a problem as he already struggles to fit in at his own high school.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="characters">
      <img src="images/char_jerry.jpg">
      <p><span>Jerry Smith</span> (Voiced by Chris Parnell) — Morty's insecure father, whose disapproval of Rick's influence on Morty only deepens his marital troubles with Beth. Jerry constantly finds himself to be in a failing marriage with his wife as they always argue and never express the love for each other that most parents do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="characters">
      <img src="images/char_beth.jpg">
      <p><span>Beth Smith</span> (Voiced by Sarah Chalke) — Morty's holier-than-thou mother who is a cardiac surgeon for horses. Beth seems to have problems in her marriage with Jerry and usually considers leaving him for another guy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="characters">
      <img src="images/char_summer.jpg">
      <p><span>Summer Smith</span> (Voiced by Spencer Grammer) — Morty's angst-ridden older sister who occasionally joins Rick on his adventures. She only cares about her friends and social life at school and is easily annoyed by her family, though she sometimes becomes jealous of Morty's relationship with Rick.</p>

    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Pickle Rick: An Absurd Adventure in Science</h1>
      <figcaption>Third episode of the third seasonn</figcaption>
      <p>"Everyday is a new adventure." - Any science fiction fan on the planet. There's no arguing Rick and Morty's iconic animated show takes this phrase to an entirely new level.</p>
      <h2>Meet the Pickle</h2>
      <screenshot src="https://cdn.videotap.com/LiVxX89Nwqlx1e3cGsBx-19.38.png"></screenshot>
      <p>From afar, this story may sound like your average day, having a conversation with an inanimate object.</p>
      <p>Or maybe not.</p><p>The conversation begins with Rick beckoning Morty to the garage, where he has seemingly transformed himself into a pickle, lying on the workbench. "Flip the pickle over," Rick mutters revealing, a surprise that would flabbergast any saneperson – Rick has indeed transformed himself into a pickle.</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>"I turned myself into a pickle Morty. Boom. Big reveal. I’m a pickle. What do you think about that?"</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Exactly, what does one think about a close figure transforming himself into a vegetable? Not every day's kitchen conversation.</p>
      <p>Well, an interesting phenomenon indeed. Morty, and later Beth and Summer, question the "pickled" scientist. Is it a magic trick? Is he going to live forever in that form? Can he fly?</p>
      <p>In typical Rick fashion, all questions are met with snide remarks and conceited responses.</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>"I don’t do magic, Morty. I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eyeliner."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>An Ambition... Too Far?</h2>
      <screenshot src="https://cdn.videotap.com/PbzfX9Z8DsuBSVHOQDW4-116.27.png"></screenshot>
      <p>Beth and Summer, get swept up in the absurdity of the situation and leave Rick in his pickle form for their pre-scheduled family counseling appointment. Morty, however, expresses suspicion, suggesting that the transformation into a pickle is an elaborate plan by Rick to escape family therapy.</p>
      <p>Rick does very little to refute Morty’s accusation, rather he amuses his family (and the audience) with sarcastic statements and well-timed jests.</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>"Can’t you just turn yourself back into a human?"<br>"Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. It could take hours or even days before I’m able to figure out how to return to human form."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As the family leaves, Morty spots a syringe dripping with a mysterious fluid hanging directly over pickle Rick, attached to a timer set for ten minutes from then. Rick's response? Classic denial and dismissal.</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>"Well, Morty, if you must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion and therefore does not warrant further explanation."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>A Pickle's Tale</h2>
      <screenshot src="https://cdn.videotap.com/5pfbH7he1xPZUEZ9o71E-193.78.png"></screenshot>
      <p>While the family debates over therapies, Rick –the pickle– has his encounter with the household cat. The cat mistakes Rick for a cucumber, playing into the popular YouTube trend showing cats being scared of cucumbers due to their resemblance to snakes. Through a series of exasperated cries, reminding the cat - and the viewer - of his “pickly" state.</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>"Whoa whoa whoa, Izzy. I’m not a snake! I’m a pickle. I’m a pickle!"</p>
      </blockquote><p>Science, absurdity, and a pickle. Rick and Morty consistently weave together tales that not only stretch the mind but keep you rolling with laughter. A man turning himself into a pickle may seem ludicrous but under the spotlight of an interdimensional mad scientist, it's a distinct possibility. No matter the absurdity, one thing's for sure - you will always be entertained.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned, something tells us more outlandish Rick and Morty antics are coming your way!</p>

        <p>Hey, Mooortyyy!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>Rick, are you far away, or are you inside something? Is this a camera? Is everything a camera?</p>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Morty. The garage, Morty. Come to the garage...</p>

    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>- on my workbench, Morty?</p>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me? </p>

        <p>Flip the pickle over.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>What? I'm going to touch it, and you're going to tell me it's an alien dick or something?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Come on. Flip the pickle, Morty. You're not going to regret it. The payoff is huge. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty. Boom. Big reveal. I'm a pickle. What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle. What are you just staring at me for, bro? I turned myself into a pickle, Morty. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>And?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>And what, Morty? What more do you want tacked onto this? I turned myself into a pickle and 9-11 was an inside job.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>Was it?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh here's something that's never happened before. I'm a pickle. I'm pickle Riiiiick!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>Is this the first part of some kind of magic trick?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>I don't do magic, Morty. I do science. One takes brains. The other takes dark eyeliner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>Well, can you move? Can you fly? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>All right, well, do pickles live forever or?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this, why anyone would do this.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>The reason anyone would do this, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog BETH">
        <p>Morty, we have to get going or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog BETH">
        <p>What? Why would you, look, we're running late. We have to go.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Where are you guys going? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog BETH">
        <p>We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Oh, my God. Beth. Oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez. Oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>Rick? did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog BETH">
        <p>Morty!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact. Morty, I assure you I would never find a way to get out of family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog SUMMER">
        <p>Can't you just turn yourself back into a human? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself, and it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human, but, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket know, if she really needs me to go.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="dialog BETH">
        <p>Nobody needs anything, okay? It's fine. You should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you. Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the timer set to ten minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Well, MoRtY, if you must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion and therefore does not warrant further explanation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog BETH">
        <p>Enough, kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>What are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="dialog BETH">
        <p>Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that going to help?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="dialog RICK">
        <p>Can't argue with that!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog BETH">
        <p>Great. We'll see you later.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialog MORTY">
        <p>Hey, be careful with that. It's for something else that's really important, so don't break it.</p>
