            Real conspiracies do exist. Volkswagen conspired to cheat emissions tests
            for their diesel engines. The U.S. National Security Agency secretly spied on
            civilian internet users. The tobacco industry deceived the public about the
            harmful health effects of smoking. We know about these conspiracies through
            internal industry documents, government investigations, or whistleblowers.

            Conspiracy theories, by contrast, tend to persist for a long time even when there is no decisive evidence for them. Those conspiracy theories are based on a variety of thinking patterns that are known to be unreliable tools for tracking reality. Typically, conspiracy theories are not supported by evidence
            that withstands scrutiny but this doesn’t stop them from blossoming. For example, the widespread belief that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an “inside job” has persisted for many years after the event.

              <h2>The Conspiracies Chart 2021</h2>
              <p>Abbie Richards, a Boston-based researcher who studies disinformation and misinformation, sought to make a “conspiracy theory framework” and break it down in a chart. The chart is organized to convey both an increasing detachment from reality and threat level, with the top grouping largely rooted in antisemitic views.</p>
              <div class="frame-container-center">
                <figure>
                  <div>
                    <a href="https://www.conspiracychart.com/" title="click here to see the full sized image"><img width="560" src="images/conspiracy.png" alt="your alt description here"></a>
                  </div>
                  <figcaption style="text-align:justify"><a class="kilde" href="https://www.abbiesr.com/">www.abbiesr.com</a></figcaption>
                </figure>
              </div> 
              <p>The chart is broken down into several sections, beginning with events that actually happened — including the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm">Tuskegee Experiment</a> and <a href="https://www.fightcancer.org/what-we-do/big-tobacco-lawsuit">Big Tobacco lying to the American public</a> about the deadly effects of its products — which Richards noted are “very different from conspiracy theories” as they are based in reality.</p>
              <p>As one passes the “speculation line” of the pyramid, they enter into the category where “there are still unanswered aspects” or where questions over said topics remain, and these “can be silly or can be very real,” Richards said. Further up the pyramid, the theories begin to leave reality — but have not yet entered into a zone where they could pose any major hazard to those who believe in them.</p>
              <p>But the categories beyond the “reality denial” line contain theories that are not only perilous to those who accept them as the truth, but to the people around them, Richards said. It’s at this point that people begin to deny history, science, and medicine. The top level of the conspiracy chart, when one crosses over the “antisemitic point of no return,” is populated with theories centered around the belief that an evil group of elites “is secretly controlling the world and hiding something from everybody,” and these are “always rooted in antisemitism,” Richards said. Such theories promote both hate and violence toward marginalized groups, she said.</p>
