              <h3>11 September 2001: The conspiracy theories still spreading after 20 years</h3>
              <p>On September 10th, 2021, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shayan-sardarizadeh-0121555a/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&originalSubdomain=uk">Shayan Sardarizadeh</a>, a journalist who specializes in investigating online disinformation, conspiracy theories, cults and extremism for BBC Monitoring and BBC World Service, published an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/58469600">article</a> about conspiracy theories on the 9/11 attack: "<span style="font-weight: 500;">11 September 2001: conspiracy theories and how they are still spreading</span>". </p>
              <p class="quote">The first 9/11 conspiracy theories appeared on the internet just hours after the attacks, on 11 September 2001, and with the rise of social media, have grown in scope and scale ever since.</p>
              <p>Extensive reports by the 9/11 Commission, US government agencies and expert groups have refuted the existence of any hidden conspiracy, but activist groups in the US, like the 9/11 Truth movement, say the facts have been hidden. Leading members of the movement have also embraced conspiracies about Covid-19 and vaccines. </p>
              <p>One of the claims widely shared online is, “Jet fuel cannot melt steel beams,” suggests that the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers were demolished by explosive. Also, the collapse of 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper in the near vicinity of the Twin Towers, has fueled many conspiracy theories questioning the collapse, which happened hours after the Twin Towers without being hit by a plane or directly targeted. </p>
              <p>Another theory falsely claims no Jewish people were killed in the attach because 4,000 Jewish employees at the World Trade Center had received advance notice not to turnup for work. </p>
